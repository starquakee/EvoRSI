</h2>

iStratDE is a minimalist yet powerful Differential Evolution (DE) variant that achieves superior performance through individual-level strategy diversity. Unlike traditional adaptive DEs that adjust strategies at the population level via feedback, iStratDE assigns mutation and crossover strategies along with their respective control parameters randomly and independently to each individual during initialization. These fixed configurations cultivate persistent behavioral heterogeneity, which effectively mitigates premature convergence, particularly in large-population and high-dimensional settings.

Designed with a communication-free architecture, iStratDE possesses intrinsic concurrency that maps naturally to GPU computing, enabling massive parallelism without synchronization bottlenecks. iStratDE is fully integrated into the <a href="https://github.com/EMI-Group/evox">EvoX</a> framework.
> **Backend Support**:
> 
> iStratDE supports both **JAX** and **PyTorch** backends.
>
> - **PyTorch Backend:**
>   - Supports **Brax-based robotic control tasks** (requires additional installation of JAX for the environment simulation).
>   - For optimal performance, we strongly recommend using **EvoX 1.1.1** or higher version with a CUDA-enabled PyTorch environment.
>
> - **JAX Backend:**
>   - Fully supported and recommended for users seeking maximum throughput with CUDA-enabled JAX.
>   - Offers superior execution efficiency, generally providing approximately **2x the speed** of the PyTorch backend.

To replicate the experimental results on **CEC2022 benchmarks** and **Brax robotic tasks** exactly as presented in the paper, you may utilize JAX backend with a CUDA-enabled installation.

## Requirements

Depending on which backend you plan to use (JAX or PyTorch), you should install the proper libraries and GPU dependencies:

- **Common**:
  - `evox >= 1.1.1` (PyTorch support)
  - `brax == 0.12.1` (optional, if you want to run Brax RL problems)
  
- **JAX**-based version:
  - `jax == 0.4.33`
  - `jaxlib == 0.4.33`

- **PyTorch**-based version:
  - `torch` (GPU version recommended, e.g. `torch>=2.5.0`)
  - `torchvision`, `torchaudio`

## Installation
### Best Practice:
```bash
pip install \
  "jax[cuda12]==0.4.33" \
  "brax==0.12.1" \
  "mujoco==3.2.7" \
  "flax==0.8.5" \
  "optax==0.2.3" \
  "orbax-checkpoint==0.6.1" \
  "numpy==1.26.4" \
  -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```
```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/EMI-Group/evox.git@v1.1.1
```
### Environment Verification
Once the installation is complete, you can verify your library versions and GPU availability by running the provided environment check script:
```bash
python show_env.py
```
This script will confirm if your hardware is correctly recognized, ensuring iStratDE can leverage its communication-free design for fully parallel updates.

## Components

### Individual-Level Strategy Pool
iStratDE attains behavioral richness by assigning a unique, immutable strategy profile to each individual at initialization. 

- **Combinatorial Diversity**: A pool of 192 distinct configurations is formed by combining various base vectors, differential vector counts, and crossover schemes.
- **Fixed Assignments**: Strategies and control parameters (F, CR) are assigned once and remain fixed throughout the evolution, ensuring persistent structural diversity across the population.

### GPU Acceleration
iStratDE is fully integrated with the EvoX framework. By utilizing a communication-free design, it achieves high hardware utilization on both JAX and PyTorch backends, making it possible to scale to massive populations for complex, high-dimensional black-box optimization.

### CEC Benchmark Problems

iStratDE supports benchmark suites such as CEC2022. Here’s an example (JAX-based) for the CEC2022 test suite:

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
import jax
from tqdm import tqdm
from istratde.util import StdSOMonitor, StdWorkflow
from istratde.problems.jax import CEC2022TestSuit
from istratde.algorithms.jax import IStratDE

# Problem setting
D = 10  # Dimension (CEC2022 supports 10D, 20D)
FUNC_LIST = jnp.arange(12) + 1  # Functions 1 to 12
key_start = 42

# IStratDE algorithm settings
POP_SIZE = 100000  # Large population size to leverage JAX parallelism
STEPS = 5000       # Total generations

# Define search space for CEC2022
lb = jnp.full((D,), -100.0)
ub = jnp.full((D,), 100.0)

for func_num in FUNC_LIST:
    # 1. Create specific CEC2022 problem instance
    base_problem = CEC2022TestSuit.create(int(func_num))
    print(f"Testing Problem: CEC2022 F{int(func_num)}")

    # 2. Initialize IStratDE
    algorithm = IStratDE(
        lb=lb,
        ub=ub,

### Robotics Control (Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning)

iStratDE is highly effective for real-world applications such as robotic control through evolutionary reinforcement learning (EvoRL). To run these robotic policy optimization examples, ensure you have installed a CUDA-enabled JAX environment along with `brax==0.12.1`.

```python
from tqdm import tqdm
from jax import random
from flax import linen as nn
import jax.numpy as jnp
import jax
import istratde.problems
from istratde.algorithms.jax import IStratDE
from istratde.util import StdSOMonitor, StdWorkflow, TreeAndVector

# 1. Define Policy Network (Swimmer: 8 obs -> 2 actions)
class SwimmerPolicy(nn.Module):
    @nn.compact
    def __call__(self, x):
        x = x.astype(jnp.float32)
        x = x.reshape(-1)
        x = nn.Dense(32)(x)
        x = nn.tanh(x)
        x = nn.Dense(32)(x)
        x = nn.tanh(x)
        x = nn.Dense(2)(x)
        x = nn.tanh(x)
        return x

# 2. Setup Parameter Adapter (Flat Vector <-> PyTree)
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
model = SwimmerPolicy()
weights = model.init(random.PRNGKey(42), jnp.zeros((8,))) # Initialize weights
adapter = TreeAndVector(weights)
vector_form_weights = adapter.to_vector(weights)
D = vector_form_weights.shape[0] # Total weight dimension

# 3. Initialize IStratDE Algorithm
steps = 100
pop_size = 10000
lb = jnp.full((D,), -10.0)
ub = jnp.full((D,), 10.0)

algorithm = IStratDE(
    lb=lb,
    ub=ub,
    pop_size=pop_size,
)

# 4. Setup Problem (Brax Swimmer)
problem = istratde.problems.jax.Brax(
    env_name="swimmer",
    policy=jax.jit(model.apply),
    cap_episode=500,
)

# 5. Initialize Workflow
monitor = StdSOMonitor(record_fit_history=False)

workflow = StdWorkflow(
    algorithm=algorithm,
    problem=problem,
    monitor=monitor,
    pop_transform=adapter.batched_to_tree, # Convert population back to tree structure
    opt_direction='max', # Maximize reward
)

# 6. Run Loop
key, _ = jax.random.split(key)
state = workflow.init(key)

for i in tqdm(range(steps), desc="Swimmer Evolution"):
    state = workflow.step(state)
    print(f"fitness: {monitor.get_best_fitness()}")

print(f"Best fitness: {monitor.get_best_fitness()}")
```
