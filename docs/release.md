# Release Artifacts and Boundaries

This repository contains the OpenMLE-Gym task-construction/evaluation tools, the supervised fine-tuning and OpenMLE-ERL training implementations, and the OpenMLE-Evo test-time search/evaluation implementation. OpenMLE Tasks is a separate task release. Training data, model weights, task artifacts, and deployment services are distributed separately from this code repository.

## OpenMLE Tasks

`OpenMLE-Tasks` is the task-environment companion release to OpenMLE. The technical report accounts for all 5,758 OpenMLE-Gym environments: full task-package data is released for 1,415 tasks, while `prepare.py` and `metric.py` reconstruction scripts are released for the remaining 4,343 tasks because source-data licensing and copyright constraints prevent redistribution.

The release uses two artifact categories:

- Category 2: rebuild recipes and processing scripts, without redistributing upstream task data.
- Category 3: complete built task packages when upstream terms permit redistribution.

## Public source scope

- OpenMLE-Gym tooling, SFT/RL training code, and test-time search/evaluation implementations are present in this code repository.
- OpenMLE Tasks is distributed as a separate task artifact.
- The reported MLE-Bench and NatureBench numbers require external task environments, sandbox services, datasets, and evaluation assets.
- BF16 model quickstarts must be paired with a tested serving/runtime matrix; each model repository records its GGUF artifact smoke under `gguf/`.
- The 35B repository retains upstream vision and MTP components, but OpenMLE post-training and reported evaluations cover text/code behavior.

## Excluded runtime material

Training corpora, model weights, checkpoints, service credentials, private infrastructure configuration, generated outputs, and deployment-specific endpoints are deliberately kept outside this code repository.
